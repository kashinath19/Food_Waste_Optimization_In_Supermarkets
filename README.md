# 🍎 Food Waste Optimization in Supermarkets in India 🛒
Welcome to the Food Waste Optimization in Supermarkets in India project! 🌟 This project tackles food waste in Indian supermarkets using data analytics to save costs and promote sustainability. 📊


## 📋 Project Overview
I analyzed food waste patterns across 10 Indian cities (e.g., Hyderabad, Bengaluru) from October 2024 to April 2025. The dataset includes 5,500 rows of supermarket data, covering categories like Meat & Seafood, Fresh Vegetables, and more. 🥕🥛 Key insights:

🚨 50% of inventory costs (33M INR) are wasted!
🥩 Meat & Seafood wastes the most (10.2M INR) due to short shelf life.
🏪 Bengaluru has the highest waste (4.1M INR) due to overstocking.

Using data cleaning with Python 🐍 and visualization with Power BI (DAX & Power Query) 📈, we provide actionable recommendations to reduce waste by 20% and save 6.6M INR. 💡

## 🛠️ Tools Used

Python 🐍: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
Power BI 📊: For data analysis and visualization using:
Power Query: To transform and load data.
DAX: To create measures (e.g., Total Cost, Waste Cost).



## 📂 Files in This Repository

food_waste_optimization_in_supermarket_dataset.csv 📄: Raw dataset with 5,500 rows, including ~9% imperfections (duplicates, nulls, format errors).
cleaned_dataset.csv 🧹: Cleaned dataset with 5,390 unique rows, ready for analysis.

## 🚀 How to Use

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/Kashianth19/Food_Waste_Optimization_In_Supermarkets


Explore the Dataset: Start with food_waste_optimization_in_supermarket_dataset.csv.
Clean the Data: Use Python scripts (e.g., data_cleaning.py) to generate cleaned_dataset.csv.
Visualize in Power BI: Open dashboard.pbix to explore insights and visuals.

## 📊 Key Insights

🥩 Meat & Seafood wastes the most (10.2M INR) due to a 3-day shelf life.
🏪 Bengaluru leads in waste (4.1M INR) due to overstocking Fresh Vegetables (151K kg).
🌡️ Hot weather (1855 instances) increases spoilage in South/West regions.

## 💡 Recommendations

📉 Dynamic Pricing: Discount Meat & Seafood by 20% near expiry to reduce waste by 15%.
❄️ Cold Storage: Upgrade storage in South/West to cut spoilage by 10%.
🤝 NGO Donation: Donate 650 kg/week of edible waste (30% increase).
